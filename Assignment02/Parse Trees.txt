3. Change the factor grammer to the following: 
Factor â†’ + Factor
       | - Factor
       | ( Expr )
       | number
       | identifier
This allows positive and negative variations. For example:
(12+-4)*8
(Expr
  (Term
    (Term (Factor (Expr
      (Expr
        (Expr (Term (Factor 12)))
        +
        (Term (Factor (- (Factor 4)))))))))
    *
    (Factor 8)))
